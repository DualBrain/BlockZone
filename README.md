BlockZone.ttf
===============

BlockZone is a faithful, pixel-perfect recreation of the original DOS font. It contains each of the 256 characters, including those in the 128-255 range, referred to as extended ASCII. BlockZone is capabable of rendering ANSI and ASCII art, in fact that is the purpose it was created for. It supports a wide range of codepages, the legendary codepage 437 (MS-DOS Latin US) as well as Baltic, Cyrillic, French Canadian, Greek, Hebrew, Icelandic, Latin-1, Latin-2, Nordic, Portuguese, Turkish charsets, Windows codepage 1252 and even more. All characters are mapped to their Unicode equivalents. You get the best results when anti-aliasing (font smoothing) is disabled. 

Current release is `Version 1.004`
